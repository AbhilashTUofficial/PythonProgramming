# Python pong game with AI

 This is an simple python pong game with an ai mode and dual player mode


USAGE:


       I created this game based of the simple classic pong game, but on i also added some new features to it
       like a multiplayer mode and an ai mode. on multiplayer mode the game can support two players. On AI mode
       the player can challenge a build in AI , but the AI is so strong that the player cant beat the AI, 
       The game has an feature to increase the speed of the ball by time and this make the game even harder
       and more nice.


WHAT I LEARNED:


       1. By developing this game i learned a lot about python and about the turtle module in python.
       
       2. This project improved my python skills quite a lot and i use this experience to build more projects.
