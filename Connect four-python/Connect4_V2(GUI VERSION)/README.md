# Python Connect four(Gui version)

 This is an simple python Connect four  game 


USAGE:


       I created this game based of the simple classic Connect four  game with GUI
       most of the logic involved in this are relatively simple and anyone can clearly understands it.
     


WHAT I LEARNED:


       1. By developing this game on numpy, i think i got some new logics

       3. i learn about the pygame module a little more
       
       2. This game was too esay, so i don't get anything special out of it.
