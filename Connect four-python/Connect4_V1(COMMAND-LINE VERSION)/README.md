# Python Connect four(terminal version)

 This is an simple python Connect four  game 


USAGE:


       I created this game based of the simple classic Connect four  game which can play on the terminal
       most of the logic involved in this are relatively simple and anyone can clearly understands it.
       This game will only work on terminal and have no user-interface.After building this game 
       i decided to make a  gui version this  same game.


WHAT I LEARNED:


       1. By developing this game on numpy, i think i got some new logics

       3. And also i find out that python dont have and do while loop
	  so i had to modify the normal while loop and make it work 
	  like an do while loop
       
       2. This game was too esay, so i don't get anything special out of it.
